# IBM_Applied_Data_Science_Captone
This Capstone is the 10th course in IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization, and it actually summarizes in the form of project all materials that have been learned during the Professional certificate.
## Project Background
SpaceX has revolutionized the commercial space industry by making space travel more affordable. The company offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million per launch, significantly lower than the $165 million charged by other providers. This cost advantage is largely due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of its rockets.

By predicting whether the first stage will successfully land, we can estimate the cost-effectiveness of a launch. Using publicly available data and machine learning models, we will analyze key factors to determine the likelihood of first-stage reuse, providing valuable insights into SpaceX's launch economics.
## Questions to be answered
1. How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits affect the
success of the first stage landing?
2. Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?
3. What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification in this case?
## Methodology
### 1. Data collection methodology
* Using SpaceX Rest API
* Using Web Scrapping from Wikipedia
### 2. Performed data wrangling
* Filtering the data
* Dealing with missing values
* Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification
### 3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
### 4. Performed interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
### 5. Performed predictive analysis using classification models
* Building, tuning and evaluation of classification models to ensure the best results
